Proxy pattern provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it. 
This can be used for lazy loading, controlling access or adding extra functionalities like 
logging or security checks when accessing an object.
real-world example: A credit card is a proxy for a bank account. It facilitates access to 
the account's funds but also adds security measures such as PIN verification and setting limits to protect the account.
